// Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.
// Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.
// Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.
// Example:
//   For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
//   areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
//   For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
//   areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
//   For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 9, the output should be
//   areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false.
